 * in a second) and can by used to add, access, and remove from memory very

     * You have to be careful though, if you had a really big key you don't want
     * to match it to a memory address that does not exist.
     *
     * So the hashing algorithm needs to limit the size, which means that there
     * are a limited number of addresses for an unlimited number of values.

     * get turned into the same address.
